/**
 * The Peer Group Manager is a library that provides app developers with an
 * easy entry point into peer-to-peer programming using AllJoyn. A peer group
 * is simply an established connection between peers that allows them to
 * communicate over AllJoyn. With this library, developers can use AllJoyn with
 * minimum knowledge of AllJoyn concepts which is great for rapid prototyping.
 * The Peer Group Manager provides a mapping between high level AllJoyn
 * concepts and underlying implementation details abstracting out some of the
 * more subtle aspects that aren√≠t always relevant to new developers of
 * AllJoyn. It also encapsulates a lot of boilerplate AllJoyn code for typical
 * applications including setting default parameters, enforcing a naming
 * convention for advertisements, etc. making the code simpler and cleaner.
 * This component only covers common use cases for typical AllJoyn applications
 * so if your project is advanced in nature, then this component might not be
 * right for you.
